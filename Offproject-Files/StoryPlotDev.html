The only highlight is the beginning television show where the champion is giving a talk to inspire all young people (the protagonist included) to take up the call of becoming a trainer. Our protagonist (from now on called Barry (because I say so)) goes to visit the local professors laboratory and picks his first partner alongside long term friend and Rival Gemma. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Route 1 - Barry ups and leaves this boring town and goes into the first route where he meets the first people on his adventure. A young boy who instructs him on the basics of the life he has chosen (Don&rsquo;t steal &lsquo;mons, keep potions stocked etc) and a kind shopkeeper who given him two potions and wishes him good luck. As he goes to enter Cleppa&rsquo;s Cave an old man runs into him and warns him of the life he has chosen saying </span><span class="c0 c3">&ldquo;You must not go, stay in Cleppa where it&rsquo;s safe. The ones in power are not on your side but plotting the downfall of us&rdquo;. </span><span class="c0">The man is clearly drunk and Barry ignores him.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cleppa&rsquo;s Cave - Cleppa&rsquo;s cave is the first taste of adventure for Barry who gets into multiple battles and catches new ground, rock and flying type pokemon to prepare for the upcoming battle. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Route 2 - In a continuation of the cave Barry battles through the route and catches more pokemon for his team including &lsquo;mons who have left the safety of the cave.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Perun Town - In Perun Barry visits the pokemon centre and mart to collect items and then visits the houses of the locals who share their stuff with him. He walks into the front of the gym where he bumps into a stranger who introduces herself as the Champion of the region and wishes Barry good luck on his adventure. She seemed nice.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gym 1 - Barry enters to hear the Benjamin (The Gym Leader) say </span><span class="c0 c3">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the orders of the champion and you will follow them. Get the inventory ordered and prepared&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Barry then faces the gym trainer and then the Leader KO&rsquo;ing the Pikachu ace! Once beaten Benjamin says </span><span class="c0 c3">&ldquo;Here, have the </span><span class="c2 c0">Ion Badge</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;and this TM for </span><span class="c2 c0">ShockWave</span><span class="c0 c3">. Now leave I have far more pressing duties to attend.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">Barry has defeated the first Gym!</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Route 3 - Barry enters Route 3 to bump into Gemma (Rival) who gives him an exp. share! Gemma congratulates him on a win and challenges him to a battle. Barry wins and carries on through the route, catching &lsquo;mons and defeating the many trainers on the way. Route 3 is long and arduous but Barry makes it alongside a new collection of Pokemon of the fighting and steel types!</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hodr City - Barry walks into the peaceful Hodr City and runs into the Gym leader who is in need of some help! There are a bunch of Geodude and Graveler who are attacking passers by and his Ice types are weak to the rocks! Barry goes and deals with the incident then finds the herb shops! He collects the herbs he wants and challenges the gym! </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gym 2 - Ranulph (Gym Leader) welcomes Barry in and sets up the challenge. Defeat all the trainers then face him to win the Aniyu badge. Barry sweeps the trainers with ease but then is forced to wait for Ranulph as he is outside talking to someone. Barry overhears </span><span class="c0 c3">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working my way onto the device but I&rsquo;m no inventor, where&rsquo;s Lumick? Why isn&rsquo;t he doing it? Fine, I&rsquo;ll finish up soon.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Ranulph returns and faces Barry and promptly loses. Post battle he says </span><span class="c0 c3">&ldquo;Good job boy. Here TM and my Aniyu Badge. Must dash, tally-ho and all that.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">Ranulph dashes off to work on the mysterious device. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Route 4 - Barry, now with two badges, enters Route 4 to see a block in the road. It is a stand-off between youngsters and robed men/women. (All done in over world sprites like Mount Pyre). Barry is dragged into the fight, taking down both robed men and youngsters and to move onto the next town. On this route there are psychic types at Hodr end but at Mani village side it is heavily dark type. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mani Village - Barry entered this village and say that there was no pokemon mart. The centre is the only inhabited place in the town with Joy being the only person in it. After some early exploration he finds a lucky egg in a kitchen and a TM for Dark Pulse at the fountain in the centre of the town. He then walks into the town hall to find an abandoned Altar and a Lunatone. The Lunatone starts to attack and Barry is forced into battle! Behind the, now caught/fallen, Lunatone is an open book. This book is open on a page that says </span><span class="c0 c3">&ldquo;The Legend of our Home. Many years ago there was simply nothing. Then our lord Arceus&hellip; </span><span class="c0 c2">the pages are ripped out. </span><span class="c0 c3">It was left to the families of Lunatone and Solrock to keep balance upon Terra&rsquo;s peak to keep night and day in the cycle it had to be. Many have tried to affect this cycle but the trio of allies of Lunatone and Solrock would always protect the oft defenseless guardians of light and dark. </span><span class="c2 c0">The book is burnt and almost unreadable. There is nothing more to be gain.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0">Barry leaves the ghost town unaware of the two previous gym leaders walking into the town hall. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mani Pass - This cave is well lit and Barry entered it optimistic but he was weary of Zubat in the cave. He meets a traveler who gives him some repels to help him on his way. In the pass he comes across the travelers who challenge him to a battle. The pass comes to a crossroads where two of the roads are blocked by geodude so Barry is left to go into Buri City!</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Route 5 - Barry walks into the route and finds it is abandoned, not a trainer in sight. It appears the cave stops most trainers. He encounters a cave entrance but is blocked by a Snorlax. It cannot be woken and so Barry leaves the route and walks into Buri, surrounded by grass / poison type pokemon. </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buri City: Barry enters Buri alongside the new friends he has made. It is the sister town of Orebrugh city, and has a steel mine underneath. After the obligatory talk to everyone in sight it is time to face the gym! Or not, as the gym leader Florence is nowhere to be found. Barry talks to the foreman who is in the crane, the foreman challenges Barry, mistaking him for a villain and after the battle tells Barry that Florence went into the mine yesterday and hasn&rsquo;t contacted anyone since Barry endeavors to find her!</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buri Mine: Upon entering the mine hordes of Zubat and Woobat flutter down and the first room is packed with them! After getting through the entrance and the Zubatian horde the rock/steel/ground types are abundant with miners having fighting types to defend themselves and collect the metals in the riches of the earth as well as handing out super repels. In the third room there is a puzzle and using the steroids (replacing the strength hm, doesn&rsquo;t have to be roids I thought it would be funny if it was) Barry gets into the final room. Inside there is a miner on the floor passed out and a woman calmly walks out of the room leaving the miner and three robed people with you. Barry dispatches the members who claim to be of the &lsquo;Holy Order&rsquo; and defenders of the realm (when spoken to the robes tell you of a better way and that they have the most powerful trainers on their side once defeated). Barry then leaves the mine and discovers that Florence is back in the gym and accepting challengers! </span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buri City II: Barry heals up and then goes to the gym and after defeating the three gym members he looks at the leader of Buri&rsquo;s rock type gym and remembers she is from the mine! You defeat her and get the </span><span class="c0 c3">Feldspar badge </span><span class="c0">as she says &ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c3">Well done, you have not only defeated me but three of my subordinates. It is a task not many can do. Now if you do not mind I have work in the mine I must finish. Tunnels don&rsquo;t dig themselves!&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(Now, for some clarification. The three subordinates are the three members of the Holy Order not, as I&rsquo;m trying to trick the player into thinking, the gym members. The idea is that if they think about the situation it shouldn&rsquo;t be hard to piece together.)</span></p></body></html>
